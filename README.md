# py-req-installer
A centralized repository for managing my core Python infrastructure dependencies. <br>
It provides a single `requirements.txt` file that aggregates all the essential packages I frequently use across projects. <br>
This approach ensures consistency, faster environment setup, and easier dependency upgrades.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Single source of truth**: Manage all infra dependencies from one file.  
- ✅ **Fast setup**: Run one command to install your entire development baseline.  
- ✅ **Consistency**: Guarantee the same environment across projects.  
- ✅ **Extensible**: Add or remove packages as needed, and version-control them.  
- ✅ **Separation of concerns**: Easily extend with additional files (`dev.txt`, `data.txt`, etc.) if needed.

### 🔧 Usage
```bash
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/py-req-installer/main/requirements.txt
````

רוצה שאעדכן לך את ה-README גם עם דוגמה איך לשלב את זה בפרויקטים אחרים (`requirements.infra.txt` ואז include ב-`pip-tools` או `-r` בתוך requirements)?
