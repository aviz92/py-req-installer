# py-requirements-deps
A centralized repository for managing my core Python infrastructure dependencies. <br>
It provides a single `requirements.txt` file that aggregates all the essential packages I frequently use across projects. <br>
This approach ensures consistency, faster environment setup, and easier dependency upgrades.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Single source of truth**: Manage all infra dependencies from one file.  
✅ **Fast setup**: Run one command to install your entire development baseline.  
✅ **Consistency**: Guarantee the same environment across projects.  
✅ **Extensible**: Add or remove packages as needed, and version-control them.  
✅ **Separation of concerns**: Easily extend with additional files (`dev.txt`, `data.txt`, etc.) if needed.

2. use the following command: `pip install git+https://github.com/aviz92/py-requirements-deps.git`
